**Overall Goal (User Story):**
As a Content Manager, I want to utilize an AI-powered tool within the ETI system to automatically generate and rewrite product descriptions, so that product card indexing by search engines improves, the percentage of low-value pages decreases, and traffic to product cards increases.

**Key Features & Requirements:**

**1. AI Model Selection and Preparation:**
    *   **Objective:** Evaluate, select, and prepare the optimal AI model for product description enhancement.
    *   **User Story:** As a System Architect, I want to evaluate and select the most suitable AI model, considering text quality, speed, cost, Russian language support, and deployment options, to ensure the chosen model effectively meets project requirements.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   **Given** a list of candidate AI models (YandexGPT Pro, GigaChat, DeepSeek, Llama 3, Mistral, Saiga 3).
        *   **When** each model is tested against criteria: quality of generated text, processing speed, operational cost (tokens), Russian language proficiency, and feasibility of local deployment.
        *   **Then** a recommendation report is produced, justifying the selection of the optimal AI model.
        *   **And** a detailed cost analysis for token usage with the selected model (and top alternatives) is documented.

**2. AI Integration into ETI System:**
    *   **Feature: Unified AI Interaction Interface**
        *   **User Story:** As a Content Manager, I want a dedicated and intuitive section within the ETI product editing interface to easily access and utilize AI functionalities for description management.
        *   **Scenario: Accessing AI Tools**
            *   **Given** I am logged into the ETI system and am viewing/editing a product.
            *   **When** I navigate to the product description section.
            *   **Then** I should clearly see options such as "AI Generate Description" and "AI Rewrite Description".

    *   **Feature: Configurable AI Operations**
        *   **User Story:** As a Content Manager, I want to be able to specify parameters (e.g., operation type, desired style, length constraints) for AI tasks to ensure the generated or rewritten descriptions meet specific content requirements.
        *   **Scenario: Parameter Configuration for AI Task**
            *   **Given** I have initiated an AI description task (e.g., "AI Rewrite Description").
            *   **When** the system presents me with configuration options.
            *   **Then** I can select "Operation Type" (e.g., Rewrite, Generate from Title, Free Prompt), define "Style" (e.g., selling, concise, technical), and set "Maximum Length" (e.g., 500 characters).

    *   **Feature: Mass Processing Capabilities**
        *   **User Story:** As a Content Manager, I want to apply AI description enhancements (generation or rewriting) to multiple products simultaneously, for instance, all products within a specific Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) or category, to efficiently update large volumes of product information.
        *   **Scenario: Mass Rewriting of Product Descriptions**
            *   **Given** I have selected a group of products or an entire SKU within ETI.
            *   **And** I have accessed the AI functionality.
            *   **When** I choose the "Mass AI Rewrite" option, configure necessary parameters (e.g., prompt, style), and confirm the operation.
            *   **Then** the system should queue and process the descriptions for all selected products using the chosen AI settings and prompts.

    *   **Feature: Selective Processing with Checkboxes**
        *   **User Story:** As a Content Manager, I want to be able to select individual products from a list using checkboxes and apply AI editing operations specifically to these chosen items, allowing for granular control.
        *   **Scenario: Selective AI Editing for Chosen Products**
            *   **Given** I am viewing a list of products in the ETI system.
            *   **When** I select several specific products using their corresponding checkboxes.
            *   **And** I choose an AI editing option (e.g., "Rewrite selected descriptions").
            *   **Then** only the descriptions of the products I have selected are processed by the AI according to the specified parameters.

**3. Prompt Engineering and Management:**
    *   **Feature: Predefined Prompts for Standard Tasks**
        *   **User Story:** As a Content Manager, I want access to a set of curated, predefined prompts for common tasks like rewriting existing descriptions and generating new descriptions from product titles, enabling quick and consistent operations.
        *   **Scenario: Using Predefined Rewrite Prompt**
            *   **Given** I have selected a product with an existing description in ETI.
            *   **And** I choose the "AI Rewrite Description" option using a predefined prompt.
            *   **When** the system applies the standard rewrite prompt, for example: "Сделай рерайт этого текста, сохраняя ключевые характеристики товара. Стиль: продающий, лаконичный, с упором на пользу для клиента. Размер до 500 знаков. Текст: [текущее полное описание товара]".
            *   **Then** the AI should generate a rewritten description based on this prompt and the product's current description.
        *   **Scenario: Using Predefined Generation Prompt from Title**
            *   **Given** I have selected a product in ETI.
            *   **And** I choose the "AI Generate Description from Title" option using a predefined prompt.
            *   **When** the system applies the standard generation prompt, for example: "Возьми название товара "[название товара]" и напиши описание. Стиль: продающий, лаконичный, с упором на пользу для клиента. Размер до 500 знаков."
            *   **Then** the AI should generate a new product description based on this prompt and the product's title.

    *   **Feature: Custom (Free) Prompt Capability**
        *   **User Story:** As a Content Manager, I want the ability to input my own custom prompts for specialized AI tasks, such as advanced SEO optimization or adherence to unique stylistic guidelines, providing maximum flexibility.
        *   **Scenario: Applying a Custom Prompt for SEO**
            *   **Given** I have selected a product and choose the "AI Free Prompt" option.
            *   **When** I enter a custom prompt like "Optimize the current description for keywords X, Y, Z, maintaining a persuasive tone and a length of 400-600 characters."
            *   **And** I initiate the AI operation.
            *   **Then** the AI should process the request based on my provided custom prompt.

    *   **Feature: Prompt Customization and Management (Administrative)**
        *   **User Story:** As a System Administrator or Power User, I want the ability to edit existing predefined prompts or create and save new ones, so that the AI's behavior can be adapted to evolving business needs and content strategies (e.g., changing default text length or incorporating new stylistic elements).

**Metrics for Success (to be quantified):**
*   **Improved Indexing:** Measurable improvement in the indexing rate of Product Cards (PKT) by major search engines.
*   **Reduced Low-Value Pages:** Significant reduction in the percentage of PKT classified as "low-value" or " малоценные и малозначимые" by search engines.
*   **Increased Organic Traffic:** Demonstrable increase in organic search traffic to PKT pages.
*   **Content Quality:** Consistently high quality, relevance, and uniqueness of AI-generated/rewritten texts, verified by content team review and potentially automated checks.
*   **Economic Efficiency:** The overall cost of the AI solution (including API calls, infrastructure, etc.) remains within the predefined budget and demonstrates a positive ROI.

**Technical Considerations (from initial input):**
*   **Preferred AI Model:** YandexGPT Pro (consideration for synchronous/asynchronous modes).
*   **Alternative AI Models:** GigaChat (SberAI), DeepSeek (potential for local deployment), Llama 3 (Meta), Mistral 7B/8x22B, Saiga 3 (RU fine-tune Mistral).
*   **Cost Analysis:** Initial analysis of token costs for GigaChat and YandexGPT has been performed and should be expanded upon.
*   **Deployment:** Options for local model deployment (requiring own server infrastructure) versus cloud-based API usage need to be finalized based on the selected model and cost-benefit analysis.
